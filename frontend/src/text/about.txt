My name is Andrew Marek and I'm a junior at Iowa State University studying
software engineering.  I have a deep passion for learning pretty much anything,
but this generally happens to manifest itself in computing-related matters.

Within the domain of computer science, I personally enjoy systems-level
programming and working with C.  Otherwise I'm a Unix nerd who really enjoys
using Linux.

Outside of computer science, I really enjoy fitness; I ran cross country for
four years in high school and had the opportunity to go to Nike Cross Nationals
in Portland, Oregon with my team.
